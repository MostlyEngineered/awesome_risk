# Risk game designed for AI

## Ruleset

Rules are designed on the original Risk Game, but planning on having a few different configurations that can be callable from a config file.  The idea is to make any level of AI automation programmable and abilities to skip the corner cases that almost never come up (like attacking with less than maximal force).

## OpenAI Gym
This will be turned into an open AI environment that will be configurable.

## Usage
Current usage is just running game.py (no argparse or config yet so configuration is just changing the dictionary in the main loop)
